This project involves building a remote-controlled car using an Arduino board, motor drivers, motors, and other components. The objective of the project is to provide an interactive and fun way for hobbyists and students to learn about robotics and programming.

The car will be controlled using a wireless remote control that sends signals to the Arduino board using Bluetooth communication. The Arduino code on the car will translate these signals into motor control commands to move the car in the desired direction.

The expected outcomes of the project include a working remote-controlled car that can be customized and extended by adding sensors, cameras, and other components. The target audience for the project is hobbyists and students who are interested in robotics and programming, and who want to learn by building a fun and engaging project.
